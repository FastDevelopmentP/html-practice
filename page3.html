      <h2>Thor’s Comeback After Boxing</h2>
      <p class="Paragraph">After slimming down for his boxing fight with Eddie Hall, Thor weighed nearly 100 pounds less than his strongman prime. Many assumed his strength career was finished. Instead, he rebuilt himself smarter: he returned to heavy pulling while keeping the conditioning, mobility, and discipline from boxing. By age 36, Thor had not only regained his power but surpassed it, showing that he could evolve as an athlete while others faded.</p>

      <h2>505kg at Eisenhart (July 2025)</h2>
      <p class="Paragraph">On July 26, 2025, in Bavaria, Germany, Thor pulled <strong>505kg (1,113 lbs)</strong> at the Eisenhart Strongman event. This lift broke his old 501kg mark and, for the first time, did so in a traditional sanctioned competition. It removed any doubt about the legitimacy of his records and showed he could hit all-time numbers under the same lights and pressure as Eddie.</p>
      <p class="Paragraph">Here is this incredible Feat <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/1m7ntFJK5E0">Thors 505 Deadlift Video</a></p>

      <h2>510kg at Giants Live (September 2025)</h2>
      <p class="Paragraph">Only eight weeks later, Thor went to Birmingham for the Giants Live Mutant World Deadlift Championships. On September 6, 2025, he pulled <strong>510kg (1,124 lbs)</strong>, the heaviest deadlift ever completed. Unlike Eddie’s 500kg attempt, which left him unconscious and injured, Thor’s lift looked smooth. Even more impressively, he went on to <strong>win the entire strongman contest</strong> the same day.</p>
      <p class="Paragraph">Here is the video of the 510kg deadlift skip to 5:15 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dri4AFlYzdk">Thors 510 Pull Video</a></p>

          <li><strong>Eddie Hall:</strong> First man ever to deadlift 500kg in competition (2016). Did it in front of thousands with maximum pressure. Paid a heavy price with his health but made history.</li>
          <li><strong>Hafthor Björnsson:</strong> Broke Eddie’s record with 501kg in 2020. Extended it to 505kg in July 2025 and then 510kg in September 2025, while still winning full strongman contests at age 36.</li>

        <h2>Conclusion: Two Legacies</h2>
        <p class="Paragraph">Eddie Hall will always be remembered as the pioneer who proved the impossible could be done. Thor Björnsson will be remembered as the man who took it further, repeatedly, and made the world record his own. Their rivalry pushed each other beyond limits, raised the ceiling for human strength, and turned a niche sport into a worldwide spectacle.</p>
