    <h2>Thor’s Comeback After Boxing</h2>
    <!-- Paragraph describing Thor's weight loss, return to training, and athletic evolution -->
    <p class="Paragraph">After slimming down for his boxing fight with Eddie Hall, Thor weighed nearly 100 pounds less than his strongman prime. Many assumed his strength career was finished. Instead, he rebuilt himself smarter: he returned to heavy pulling while keeping the conditioning, mobility, and discipline from boxing. By age 36, Thor had not only regained his power but surpassed it, showing that he could evolve as an athlete while others faded.</p>

    <h2>505kg at Eisenhart (July 2025)</h2>
    <!-- Paragraph describing the 505kg lift and its significance -->
    <p class="Paragraph">On July 26, 2025, in Bavaria, Germany, Thor pulled <strong>505kg (1,113 lbs)</strong> at the Eisenhart Strongman event. This lift broke his old 501kg mark and, for the first time, did so in a traditional sanctioned competition. It removed any doubt about the legitimacy of his records and showed he could hit all-time numbers under the same lights and pressure as Eddie.</p>

    <!-- Section about Thor's 510kg deadlift at Giants Live -->
    <h2>510kg at Giants Live (September 2025)</h2>
    <!-- Paragraph describing the 510kg lift and its context -->
    <p class="Paragraph">Only eight weeks later, Thor went to Birmingham for the Giants Live Mutant World Deadlift Championships. On September 6, 2025, he pulled <strong>510kg (1,124 lbs)</strong>, the heaviest deadlift ever completed. Unlike Eddie’s 500kg attempt, which left him unconscious and injured, Thor’s lift looked smooth. Even more impressively, he went on to <strong>win the entire strongman contest</strong> the same day.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion: Two Legacies</h2>
    <!-- Paragraph reflecting on the impact of Eddie and Thor's rivalry -->
    <p class="Paragraph">Eddie Hall will always be remembered as the pioneer who proved the impossible could be done. Thor Björnsson will be remembered as the man who took it further, repeatedly, and made the world record his own. Their rivalry pushed each other beyond limits, raised the ceiling for human strength, and turned a niche sport into a worldwide spectacle.</p>
