      <h2>First off, what is a deadlift?</h2>

      <!-- Images rely on Bootstrap's .img-fluid (scales) and custom rounded styling -->
      <img

        class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block mb-3" />

      <!-- Shared paragraph style via .Paragraph for subtle background and padding -->
      <p class="Paragraph">
        A deadlift is a weightlifting exercise where a person lifts a loaded barbell from the ground to the hips, then lowers it.
        It’s one of the three powerlifts (with squat and bench) and heavily involves the lower back, glutes, hamstrings, and core—plus forearms and traps.
        In strongman, athletes must pull conventionally (hands outside feet) and may use supportive gear (e.g., deadlift suits, figure-8 straps), depending on the contest.
        These distinctions matter because “world record deadlift” claims vary by ruleset. In common conversation, people usually mean the strongman record in competition—like Eddie “The Beast” Hall’s 500 kg (1,102 lb) lift.

      <!-- Narrative sections (kept as original) -->
      <h2>The Road to Eddie Hall’s 500 kg Deadlift</h2>
      <p class="Paragraph">
        In 2016, Eddie Hall shocked the strength world by deadlifting 500 kilograms (1,102 pounds) at the Giants Live World Deadlift Championships in Leeds, England.
        The strain left him with nosebleeds and near blackout—but he became the first to break the half-ton barrier, declaring no one would surpass it without dire consequences.

      <h2>After the Dispute, Thor Enters the Conversation</h2>
      <p class="Paragraph">
        Hafthor Julius Björnsson (“The Mountain”)—2018 World’s Strongest Man—set his sights on 501 kg. In 2020, during lockdowns, he announced an attempt to top Eddie’s mark.
      </p>

      <h2>The Controversy</h2>
      <p class="Paragraph">
        Thor’s 501 kg attempt occurred in his Iceland home gym with calibrated plates and referees, broadcast live. Eddie argued it wasn’t equivalent to a Giants Live arena setting.
        The disagreement intensified across interviews and social media.
      </p>

      <h2>Thor’s First World Record Deadlift</h2>
      <p class="Paragraph">
        On May 2, 2020, Thor successfully deadlifted 501 kg, breaking Hall’s record. Debate continued over context, but the number was historic.
      </p>
