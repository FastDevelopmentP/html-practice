    <h1>Welcome to the Breakdown of Eddie Hall vs Hafthor Julias Bornson Deadlift World Record</h1>
    <h3>First off, what is a deadlift?</h3>
    <p>A deadlift is a weightlifting exercise where a person lifts a loaded barbell or bar from the ground to the level of the hips, then lowers it back to the ground. It is one of the three main lifts in powerlifting, along with the squat and bench press. The deadlift primarily targets the muscles in the lower back, glutes, hamstrings, and core, but also engages other muscle groups such as the forearms and traps. The deadlift is known too be one of the truest tests of strength and has been used in strongman since the begining of the sport. However there is a catch. In strongman sport, the strongman are only allowed to deadlift the bar with their hands outside of their feet. This is called conventional deadlifting. This is different from powerlifting where the lifters are allowed to pull the bar sumo style with their hands inside of their foot placement. The other thing that makes the strongman deadlifting unique is the use of supportive gear. This does not hold true for every single strongman competetion but at the Giants Live Deadlift Championships which is considered by most to be the pinnicle of deadlift championships, the athletes are allowed to wear a tight elastic suit which increases their force production along with figure 8 lifting straps which go around the barbell and on to the athletes wrists to keep their grip from failing. These distinctions are very important to understand because there are many different deadlift records all with there own set of rules. When people talk about the world record deadlift, they are usually refering to the strongman style deadlift record in a competetion setting. Like this 500kg or 1100 pound deadlift by Eddie "The Beast" Hall.</p>

    <h3><p> So what was the dispute? The Road to Eddie Hall’s 500kg Deadlift </p></h3>

    <p> In 2016, Eddie Hall shocked the strength world by deadlifting 500 kilograms (1,102 pounds) at the Giants Live World Deadlift Championships in Leeds, England. This was a milestone that many thought was impossible for a human being to achieve.

Hall’s lift came at a tremendous cost — he later admitted that the strain caused him to temporarily lose vision, experience nosebleeds, and nearly pass out. Still, his determination to be the first man to break the half-ton barrier cemented his legacy. Eddie declared that no one would ever break his record, and if they did, it would “kill them.” </p>
